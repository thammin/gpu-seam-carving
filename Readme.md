An experiment to implement Seam Carving with compute shader. The algorithm is based on [this paper](https://pacman.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/~cwg/papers_cwg/icpads14.pdf), which calculate non-cumulative energy between pixels parallelly. The calculated seam is not optimal but could be performs in very short time.
